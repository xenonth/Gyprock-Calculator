## Purpose
An easy to use web application for mobile to calculate total weight of a load to ensure that it is within legal wieght limits.  

## Layout and Features
An easy to use and interactive calculator setup that uses React State inside class components to calculate weight totals of different sheet types.  Each weight total is isolated to its specific sheet type. Additionally, there is also a Material UI navbar utilising react-routing which jumps the user between the different sheet types.  

Downside of this is that the state will reset to 0 if a user leaves the page so the firm has been encouraged to write down the weight total of each sheet type before transferring to a different sheet type.
